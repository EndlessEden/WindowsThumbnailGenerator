# Windows Thumbnail Generator
This application aims to recreate the missing feature of folder thumbnails in Windows 11.

It uses ImageMagick to composite media thumbnails in a folder to create a thumbnail, and generates a desktop.ini file to set it as the thumbnail.

## Usage
The usage is simple.

1. Download the application from the <a href="./releases">Releases</a> page
2. Start up `Thumbnail Generator.exe`
3. Choose a directory
4. Choose whether to generate thumbnails recursively (If checked, the application will create thumbnail icons for subfolders as well.)
5. Press start and wait.

The application will automatically generate thumbnails and place them in correct directories.
