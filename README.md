# Windows Thumbnail Generator
This application aims to recreate the missing feature of folder thumbnails in Windows 11.

It uses ImageMagick to composite media thumbnails in a folder to create a thumbnail, and generates a desktop.ini file to set it as the thumbnail.

## Usage
The usage is simple. Start up the application, choose a directory, choose whether to generate thumbnails recursively, and press start.

The application will automatically generate thumbnails and place them in correct directories.
